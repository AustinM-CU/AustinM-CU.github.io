    <p> <h1> <b>Hello my name is Austin McClendon (he/him) and welcome to my website</b>  </h1>  <br>

    <h3> I am a business major studying Marketing, Business Analytics and Information Managment and Analytics.<br>
        I am a <mark>HUGE</mark> soccer fan and in the winter, a big time snowboarder. <br>
        I am from Texas but have been consumed by the <em>outdoorsy lifestyle</em> of Colorado.<br>

        In this course I really want to refine my overall coding and typing skills and hopefully learna  thing or 2 about websites along the way.
