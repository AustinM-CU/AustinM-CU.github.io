            <h2> Bio</h2>  
            <a href="https://www.bluebell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" a>Blue Bell Creameries</a> is an American food company that manufactures ----ice cream----. It was founded in 1907 in Brenham, Texas. 
            For much of its early history, the company manufactured both ice cream and butter locally.
            In the mid-20th century, it abandoned butter production and expanded to the entire state of Texas and soon much of the 
            Southern United States. The company's corporate headquarters are located at the "Little Creamery" in Brenham, Texas.
            Since 1919, it has been in the hands of the Kruse family. As of 2015, Blue Bell was the #2 selling ice cream manufacturer 
            in the United States.

    <div id="History">
        <p>
            <h2> History</h2> 
        </p>
        <p>The company has its roots in the Brenham Creamery Company, which opened in 1907 to purchase excess cream from local dairy farmers and sell butter to people in Brenham, Texas, a town situated approximately 70 miles (110 km) northwest of Houston. In 1911, the creamery began to produce small quantities of ice cream.[7]
        </p>
        <p>By 1919, the Creamery was in financial trouble and considered closing its doors. The board of directors hired E.F. Kruse, a 23-year-old former schoolteacher, to take over the company on April 1, 1919. Kruse refused to accept a salary for his first few months in the position so that the company would not be placed in further debt.[8] Under his leadership, the company expanded its production of ice cream to the surrounding Brenham area and soon became profitable. At his suggestion, the company was renamed Blue Bell Creameries in 1930 after Kruse's favorite wildflower the Texas bluebell, which, like ice cream, thrives during the summer.[5][7]

    <div id="Products">
        <p>
            <h2> Products</h2> 
            Blue Bell produces over 250 different frozen products. Of these, 66 are flavors of <a href="https://emilyharris1.github.io/wa/wa3.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Ice Cream</a>. 
            Twenty of the flavors are offered year-round, while an additional two to three dozen are offered seasonally.
            In addition to ice cream, the company produces frozen yogurt, sherbet, <a href="https://kellyytruong.github.io/wa/wa3.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" a>Ice Cream Sandwiches</a>, and an array of frozen treats on a stick.
            Unlike competitors which have reduced their standard containers to 48-56 fluid ounces (1.42-1.66 L), 
            Blue Bell continues to sell true half-gallon (64 fl oz/1.89 L) containers, a fact it mentions prominently in its advertising.
        </p>
        <p>The company introduced its flagship flavor, Homemade Vanilla, in 1969[5] and was the first company to mass-produce the flavor cookies 'n cream.[28] Although the company at one time made cookies 'n cream from Nabisco's Oreo cookies, buying ordinary retail packages, today it bakes its own cookies.[18] As of 1997, Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla was the best-selling single flavor of ice cream in the United States,[9] and in 2001, Forbes named Blue Bell the best ice cream in the country.</p>
        <p>R.W. Apple Jr., of The New York Times claimed in 2006 that "[w]ith clean, vibrant flavors and a rich, luxuriant consistency achieved despite a butterfat content a little lower than some competitors, it hooks you from the first spoonful. Entirely and blessedly absent are the cloying sweetness, chalky texture, and oily, gummy aftertaste that afflict many mass-manufactured ice creams.</p>

    <div id="Operations">
        <p>
            <h2> Operations</h2> 
        </p>
        <p>As of 2015, the company operated three manufacturing facilities, with the largest facility in Brenham, and auxiliary facilities in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and Sylacauga, Alabama. Before the 2015 recalls, there were 50 sales and distribution centers, known as branches, spread throughout its 23-state market. These facilities employed a combined 2,800 employees, with 850 of the employees working out of Brenham. In 2006, annual sales exceeded $400 million.</p>
        <p>Blue Bell retains control over all aspects of its business, primarily to ensure quality control and the use of the freshest ingredients available.[11] The Kruses claim "the milk we use is so fresh it was grass only yesterday."[18] The company uses milk from approximately 60,000 cows each day, and the cream used during each day's production run is always less than 24 hours old. All production and packaging takes place within Blue Bell facilities, which are able to produce over 100 pints per minute.[18][19] Drivers of delivery vehicles personally stock store shelves so they can ensure it is handled properly.</p>

            <h2> 2015 listeriosis outbreak</h2> 
            <p>In 2015, Blue Bell issued its first recall in its 108-year history. The recall was issued on an assortment of items produced at its creameries, due to the discovery of five cases of listeriosis in Kansas believed to be caused by products produced at its creamery in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.[31] Three of the five patients with listeria died.[32]</p>
            <p>Despite a series of subsequent recalls, and the temporary shutdown of its Broken Arrow plant, "an enhanced sampling program" launched by Blue Bell produced "several positive tests for Listeria in different places and plants", including three further cases in Texas.[33] As a result, on the evening of April 20, 2015, the company took precautionary measures and expanded its recall to cover all of its products leading to the disposal of over eight million gallons of product in a sanitary landfill.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the company shut down production and commenced cleanup and repair operations at its manufacturing facilities. The FDA found that the company failed to follow standard practices to prevent contamination; two years prior to the recalls, the company "repeatedly found listeria" in its Broken Arrow facility.[36] At its main production facility in Brenham, one of its production machines (which produced most of the recalled products) was so contaminated that Blue Bell announced it would permanently stop using the machine, and condensation was also reported in parts of the Brenham facility.[37]</p>
            <p>Although a spokeswoman for Blue Bell had previously demurred on the subject of job losses,[38] on May 15, Blue Bell announced a series of job cuts and furloughs.[39] 1,450 (or 37 percent) of the company's employees would be laid off, while another 1,400 employees were furloughed until cleanup/repair operations concluded, and the remaining 1,050 involved in essential operations and cleanup/repair operations had wage reductions imposed on them.            </p>           
            <p>In addition, due to limited supply and distribution capabilities expected in the near term, Blue Bell announced it would suspend operations at 15 of its over 50 distribution centers indefinitely, though it has not ruled out returning to these markets eventually.</p>
